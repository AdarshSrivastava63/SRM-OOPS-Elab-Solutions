// Sachin and his pills:

/* Sachin visits his family doctor on a date given in the format yyyy:mm:dd. Sachin's doctor suggests him to take pills every alternate day starting from that day.

Sachin being a forgetful person are pretty sure wonâ€™t be able to remember the last day he took the medicine and would end up in taking the medicines on wrong days.

So he come up with the idea of taking medicine on the dates whose day is odd or even depending on whether dd is odd or even.

Now your task is to find the number of pills Sachin took on right time before messing up for the first time.
